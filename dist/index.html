        <div><strong>Job Description</strong></div>
        <p class="my-05">
            Full Stack developer in couple of projects.
            First one (AutoApp) was an online service for requesting car health.
            I was PHP (Laravel), Node.js and ReactJS developer on that project.
            The second project was a social networking project named Wikievent,
            which I was PHP (Laravel and Codeigniter) developer on that project.
            I also was the SQL writer in all projects. I was the Pendara’s CEO consultant in technical decisions.

        <p>
            I was the head of designing Wikievent project’s database (MySQL). I performed the
            migration from Codeigniter framework to Laravel in Wikievent project. I also proposed the migration from VPS
            to Clouding (based on Docker system) because of it’s advantages, which was approved by Pendara’s CEO. I
            proposed perform Application Testing and Documenting to make the development path more reliable and make the
            project more scale able which was approved by Pendara’s CEO. In AutoApp project I proposed the Long Polling
            System instead of WebSocket which reduced the pressure on server. I also found the formula for getting the
            nearby cars on the map by trigonometric calculations.

        <h2><span>&raquo;Usage</span></h2>
        <p class="my-05">Using it is pretty straight forward. Create several(as much as you need) divs or &laquo;section&raquo;
            elements each with it's unique id to hold your content. Make sure to have an error section (id="error") with
            some information to warn the user when he/she mistypes a command or if there is no section with that name,
            think of it as a 404 page.</p>
        <p>A section with id="help" is also required so you can list all the available sections and let your users know
            what words to write to access that particular content.</p>
        <p>The input field must be a standalone element and must not be placed inside any of the content divs or
            sections, and make sure you give it a classname "command", if you want to name it anything else you need to
            edit the app.js and change all instances of .command in the script to match your chosen classname.</p>
        <p>In short, just view the source code of this demo, copy/modify it to your liking making sure you include the
            error and help sections.</p>
